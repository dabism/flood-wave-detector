## Notebook location:
In the **_ativizig-phase-3/Marci-notebooks_** folder in a gcp bucket.\
Both of the notebooks are needed in order to test.

## Database.ini
The notebook expects the database.ini file one folder out from the notebook,\
so if the notebook is at _**.../src/notebooks**_, then the ini should be at _**.../src**_
